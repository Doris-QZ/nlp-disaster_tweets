# Introduction
In this Kaggle competition, [Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/overview), my goal is to build a deep learning model---specifically, a Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) ---to predict whether a given tweet is about a real disaster (class 1) or not(class 0).

### Data
The training set contains 7613 records with five attributes: id, keyword, location, text, and target, where the text column contains tweets and the target column provides the label of the tweet (1: disaster, 0: non-disaster).
